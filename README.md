# Map-Navigator
This project involves building a machine learning model to compute the probability of an e-commerce transaction being fraudulent. Using a dataset of transaction data and a corresponding IP-to-country mapping file, this analysis aims to identify patterns indicative of fraudulent activity and create an automated workflow for real-time prediction.
